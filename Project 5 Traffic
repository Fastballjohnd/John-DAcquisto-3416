Explanation:
load_data(data_dir) reads and resizes all images while correctly assigning labels from the directory structure.

get_model() creates a CNN with increasing filter depths, dropout for regularization, and softmax output for classification.

Make sure to document your experimentation process in README.md, including insights into different architectures, dropout impact, and performance trade-offs.

A final test accuracy of 95.35% is quite solid for traffic sign recognition.

A few areas for further refinement:

Data Augmentation: Improve generalization by applying transformations like rotation, brightness adjustments, and noise to training images.

More Convolutional Layers: Adding depth may enhance feature extraction, especially for complex signs.

Learning Rate Scheduling: Fine-tune training by decreasing learning rate over epochs to stabilize later-stage learning.

Batch Normalization: Helps speed up convergence and improve performance stability.
